binary tree,~ Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have no more than two child nodes.,~

doubly linked list, doubly linked, doubly-linked,~ Doubly-linked list is a linked-list data structure with two references in each node: one that refers to the next node in the list and one that refers to the previous node in the list.,~

queue,~ An abstract data type that manages information in a first-in, first-out manner.,~

array, arrays,~ An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.,~

arraylist, array list,~ An ArrayList is a dynamic data structure, meaning items can be added and removed from the list.,~
