node, node property, heap property, property,~ ,~

sort, heapsort,~ A sorting algorithm mainly used for arrays and lists due to its favourable worst-case runtime but it is not a stable sort.,~

preorder,~ Preorder traversal in Heaps is a sequence of visited nodes where the pointer traverse the parent node first, then the left child and then the right child.,~

inorder,~ Inorder traversal in Heaps is a sequence of visited nodes where the pointer traverse the left child node first, then the parent node and then the right child node.,~

postorder,~ Postorder traversal in Heaps is a sequence of visited nodes where the pointer traverse the left child node first, then the right child node and then the parent node.,~
